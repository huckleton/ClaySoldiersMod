When activated the dispenser will disrupt according to the disruptors' settings.

sanlib.lexicon.claysoldiers.misc.chestaccess.text=If you don't want to always drop items on the ground for soldiers to pick it up, you can have them pick it up from chests nearby.\n\nNaturally, soldiers won't look for inventories. To make them do so you need to attach an Item Frame containing a brick doll to an inventory of your choosing. Make sure the frame is within the sight of the soldier - putting a frame on just the front of a chest will prevent soldiers standing behind the chest from accessing it.\n\nIf you want to make sure only a specific team can access an inventory, use the doll of that team instead of the brick doll.\n\nYou can attach a frame to any block with an inventory, be it chests, trapped chests, hoppers, droppers, dispensers and much more, and the soldiers are able to access it.
